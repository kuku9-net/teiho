{{< center catastrophe.webp>}}

There have been a number of " urgent issues" for decades.
People seem to be doing something to deal with them, but while it may make things worse, there is no real sense that we are moving toward a solution.
Everyone is finding their own convenient causes, self-justification, and blame-shifting.
In the end, they are all heading straight for the obvious conclusion.
I think you are spending your days with only a growing sense that we are approaching an apocalyptic future.

Perhaps you might believe that if we could identify the "cause" that led to this "result" and resolve it.
Unfortunately, such thinking will not improve society.

Let's start with the analogy of earthquake and then consider about social networks.

# 地震 = 社会ネットワーク
{{< center model.webp >}}

Have you ever heard of the term "complex systems"?
Even modern science cannot predict earthquakes because they are complex systems.
The figure above models an earthquake.
Imagine the ground cut into a grid transmitting vibrations to each other via springs.
The following two points should be kept in mind regarding the difficulty of predicting earthquakes

- Take a look at one of the squares in the figure above. If you zoom in on that one square and separate it with a grid, you will see the same structure as in the original figure. This indicates that **micro efforts come together to determine the macro result**.
- Because of the complexity of so many parameters, **a slightly different way of transmitting vibration can produce completely different results**.

Social networks can be thought of in the same way as earthquakes.
A square is a person and a spring is considered a relationship.
The vast number of relationships between humans - talking, buying and selling, organizing, etc. - make up a far more complex network than earthquakes, and are even more difficult to predict than earthquakes.
We do not know the cause and effect of our actions and results, so <ins>we cannot control the macro results as we want them to be</ins>!

If the micro-behavior is right, it will accumulate to the right result.
We are heading toward the wrong outcome because our daily life is wrong.

This is also asserted by Mahatma Gandhi as well.

# ガンディ
{{< center gandhi.webp >}}

Gandhi insists that there is no distinction between means and ends. He tells us not to think in terms of the larger purpose and the means to get there, but only in terms of pursuing the way we ought to live. Everything in life is a means to an end and an end in itself.

It is important to keep in mind that while one can find a single history or narrative from the macro results, this ignores the many micro workings.
We should not rely on technology, government, or other "big forces" to fix the big problems that we could consequently find.
It will cause just another distortion of convenient justice that ignores the "small voices".
When this "big force" is controlled by those with a narrow view, inhumane violence arises.
There needs to be a **bottom-up solution** by a chain of events, first by you, then by your neighbor, then by that neighbor's neighbor, and so on.

With this in mind, Gandhi began to spin a yarn called charka
because he considered that accepting British manufacturing technology was equivalent to the Indians themselves offering India to the British.
<ins>Gandhi's independence movement is the pursuit of a way of life that does not depend on an ungovernable "big forces".</ins>

For self-governance, we need to understand the structures of domination that cause people to lose their independence.

# 構造
{{< center structure.webp >}}

The monopolization of most wealth by a few is often criticized.
However, the wealthy can exist because of the people who support them.
While each layer supports the layer above itself (some feel dissatisfied with it, others feel comforted by a sense of subservience), they do not consider what they are being supported by.
As we all know, the blood of those who strayed from this structure is still flowing.
Everyone who supports this structure is responsible for this problem, and it is irresponsible to pass it on to upper management.
<ins>We must reject the structure itself.</ins>

{{< center stable-structure.svg fit >}}

Structures that are not properly allocated, such as the one on the left side of above figure, are unstable and will collapse before they become large.
In other words, the fact the current dominance structure is so huge implies that it has achieved a **smooth power gradient** that can sustain such a structure.
When institutions and technology allow for proper redistribution to "make a better society," domination is smoothed out and structures are stabilized.
Stabilization of the structure allows the structure to be maintained even as disparities widen.

In addition, according to "system justification theory" by social psychologist John T. Jost, people have a desire to justify the system because they dislike instability and disorder. Therefore, it has been confirmed that even those who are in inferior positions in the structure tend to blame the inferior individuals rather than the structure. This psychology causes people to voluntarily enslave themselves to the structure.

# 革命→移行
{{< center next-order.webp >}}

When a structure reaches its limits, those who depend on it are sacrificed. In particular, priority is given to those at the end of the structure to be cut off.
To avoid this, we need a **next order** that could be escape from a structure-independent.
It takes a reasonable amount of time to grow order.
It must be nurtured steadily and steadily, while relying on the current structure.

When the brand-new order exceeds a certain size through solidarity among those at the end, it becomes easier to abandon the existing structure, leading to further expansion of scale.
When such a loop is formed, the existing structure will collapse.


# こちら側と合理性
{{< center sides.webp >}}

If we think of building the next order in the image of a social network, it would be to form a **this side** that is disconnected from the **that side** that supports the existing structure.

The "that side" is highly structure-dependent, made up of people who seek comfort in their subservience to the power, and who are unable to move away from it.
Polished by intense competition, modern society has fallen into a ludicrous rationality.
People buy things they don't know they really want, work at meaningless jobs, follow unjustified authority, and live without considering what they are sacrificing.
That is the "that side".

There are those who have doubts about such people and wish to pursue their own independent activities.
The network of such people is "this side".
It is not obvious what the ideal society is.
However, it is not difficult to make it better than the "that side".

{{< center chasm.webp fit >}}


To live "this side" that does not conform to current rationality would be an irrational choice.
Therefore, **those without spontaneity** will irrationally not bother to come to this side.
Whether the scale on this side can cross the chasm depends on <ins>how many people have the intelligence to imagine what they are losing in return for rationality</ins>.


If the new order failed to form, the world will continue to move toward a complete order that does not allow even the slightest chaos.
As the structure stabilizes, those who are no longer needed will in turn be cut off.
In such a world, if one resists embedding the self in the structure, they will be cut down.
